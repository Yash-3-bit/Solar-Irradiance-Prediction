# Solar-Irradiance-Prediction
Solar irradiance prediction involves forecasting the amount of solar energy reaching a given area over a specific time period. This is critical for optimizing solar power generation, energy storage, and grid management. Here's an overview of the key concepts, methods, and tools involved:
Prediction Methods
Physical Models:

Use atmospheric and astronomical data to predict solar irradiance.
Example: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models like WRF-Solar.
Statistical Models:

Rely on historical data to find patterns and trends.
Techniques: Time series analysis, regression models.
Machine Learning (ML) Models:

Use large datasets to learn complex relationships between input features (e.g., weather data, satellite imagery) and solar irradiance.
Common ML techniques:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
Neural Networks (e.g., LSTMs for time series data)
Deep learning models like CNNs for spatial data (e.g., satellite imagery).
Hybrid Models:

Combine physical and statistical/ML approaches for improved accuracy.
Data Sources
Ground-Based Measurements:

Pyranometers and pyrheliometers at weather stations.
High accuracy but limited spatial coverage.
Satellite Data:

NASA's POWER project.
Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).
Reanalysis Data:

Datasets combining observations and models, such as ERA5.
Tools and Frameworks
Programming Languages:

Python, R, MATLAB.
Libraries and Packages:

Python: pvlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras.
R: solar package, caret for ML.
Visualization Tools:

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (Python).
ggplot2 (R).
Cloud Platforms:

Google Earth Engine for satellite data.
AWS and Azure for large-scale computation.
